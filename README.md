# Hi, I'm Tafadzwa! 👋

I’m a Solutions Architect and Developer passionate about building scalable, secure, and resilient cloud solutions. I enjoy turning complex problems (AI, distributed systems, multi-tenant apps, observability) into clean, practical architectures that actually work in production. When I’m not building in the cloud, you’ll probably find me playing soccer, cycling, reading manga, or thinking about my next side project.

## What I’m Working On

- Building GenAI demos with Amazon Bedrock (RAG, agents, structured outputs)
- Multi-tenant SaaS architectures (Next.js + serverless + managed databases)
- Observability patterns with CloudWatch, OpenSearch, and Grafana
- Writing and sharing technical deep-dives
